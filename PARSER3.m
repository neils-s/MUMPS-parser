    ; ====  OVERVIEW  ====
    ; This contains analysis tools to apply to a grammer (as defined by the syntax maps described in ^PARSER1).
    ; It also contains a few generic analysis tools that apply to the parse tree returned by the code in ^PARSER1.
    ; These tools are mainly just applications of the tree manipulation tools from ^PARSER2.
    ;
    ; The class of syntax diagrams that can be analyzed by these tags are those that consist of:
    ;       1) string literals
    ;       2) options
    ;       3) delimited lists
    ;       4) named tokens.
    ; Note that it's possible to draw a syntax diagram that isn't of this form, but that's actually 
    ; pretty tricky.
    ;
    ;
    ; ====  TECHNICAL TERMINOLOGY  ====
    ; The parser uses a sytax map, which is of the following form:
    ;       @map@(token1Name) = subtree1
    ;       @map@(token2Name) = subtree2
    ;                        ...
    ;       @map@(tokenName)  = subtree
    ; where each subtree is a MUMPS array describing the structure of each corresponding token. 
    ; The subtrees are described in greater detail below.
    ; For now, just observe that the syntax map requires at least one token definition, 
    ; and the first coordinate of the @map array consists of only token names.
    ;
    ; The structure of the subtrees, is of the generic form:
    ;               @subtree = subtree type
    ;               @subtree@("force") = the behavior of the parser to force when parsing any literals defined in this or deeper subtrees.
    ;               @subtree@(subnodes) = additional data.
    ; The additional data can be quite extensive, and include references to other tokens, lists of options, string literal, etc.
    ;
    ; We allow these 6 types of subtrees:
    ;       1) "" to denote an empty subtree.  This is typically used with "options" and sometimes with "delimList".
    ;       2) "literal" for string literals,
    ;       3) "subtreeChain" to allow us to easily concatenate multiple subtrees together.
    ;       4) "options" to denote a list of options,
    ;       5) "delimList" to denote a delimited list,
    ;       6) "token" to reference another token.  Effectively, this is just a named subtree.
    ;
    ; For examples of these token types and the structures of the tokens, see the comments in the ^PARSER1 routine.
    ;
    ;
    ; *******************************
    ;
    ; This tag finds all other tokens referenced by a specified token
    ; This actually requires searching deeply in the token definition subtree, 
    ; since token references can be buried beneath other structures.
    ; Consider this example:
    ;       @map@("token3") ="subtreeChain"
    ;       @map@("token3",1)="literal"
    ;       @map@("token3",1,"value")="[["
    ;       @map@("token3",2)="delimList"
    ;       @map@("token3",2,"delimiter")="literal"
    ;       @map@("token3",2,"delimiter","value")="::"
    ;       @map@("token3",2,"listObject")="token"
    ;       @map@("token3",2,"listObject","value") = "token1"
    ;       @map@("token3",3)="literal"
    ;       @map@("token3",3,"value")="]]"
    ; Note that the reference to token1 is contained inside of a delimList reference.
    ; Another example is
    ;       @map@("token6")="options"
    ;       @map@("token6",1)="" ; the empty option
    ;       @map@("token6",2)="subtreeChain"
    ;       @map@("token6",2,1)="literal"
    ;       @map@("token6",2,1,"value")="("
    ;       @map@("token6",2,2)="token"
    ;       @map@("token6",2,2,"value")="token6"
    ;       @map@("token6",2,3)="literal"
    ;       @map@("token6",2,3,"value")=")"
    ;       @map@("token6",3)="token"
    ;       @map@("token6",3,"value")="token1"
    ; Here, there is a recursive reference to token6 and a reference to token1 inside of a subTreeChain.

    ; This is the recursion step in Tarjan's algorithm.
    ; This function takes in a node in a graph and returns the lowest index of any node reachable by following edges of the graph.
    ; This function calls itself recursively.
    ; This function should not be called directly!!!  If you need this functionality, call dagStrongComponents instead.
    ; The parameters of this function are:
    ;       node - the current node
    ;       adjacencyMapPointer - a string pointer to an array containing the lists of adjacent nodes
    ;                 This should have the form
    ;                     @adjacencyMapPointer@(node,anotherNode) = <truthy>
    ;   nodeIndex - An array (pass by reference) containing the index of each node found so far
    ;           The root of nodeIndex will contain the largest index.
    ;   lowestReachableIndex - an array (pass by reference) containing the smallest index of any node in stackOfBackedgedNodes
    ;                  that can be reached by following edges from a given node.
    ;   assumeSelfAdjacent - If this is truthy, we'll assume each node has an implicit edge connecting it to itself.
    ;                This assumption is necessary in the true version of Tarjan's algorithm, because without it the strongly
    ;                connected components of the graph don't necessarily include all nodes in the graph.
    ;                When any cycle is "bad", though, it's nice if this assumption doesn't hold.  After all, we don't want
    ;                to try to sift out the true cycles of size 1 from the bajillion cycles we introduce by assuming all
    ;                nodes have an self-adjacent edge.
    ;   stackOfBackedgedNodes - An array (pass by reference) of this form:
    ;                        stackOfBackedgedNodes("stack") = n where n is the number of nodes on the stack
    ;                        stackOfBackedgedNodes("stack",1) = 1st node on the stack

    ;                               This will be built and destroyed recursively by the algorithm
    ;       componentList - An array (pass by reference) that will store the list of discovered components.  It has the form:
    ;                        componentList(<node>) = <index of the root of the component the node is in>
    ;           This will be built recursively by the algorithm.
    ;           All nodes with the same value in componentList are in the same strongly connected component.
    ;           Depending on the setting of assumeSelfAdjacent, it's possible that some elements of componentList
    ;           will be of the form componentList(node)="".  These nodes are not in any strongly connected component.
    ; The crucial fact that makes Tarjan's algorithm work is that after each time lowestNodeReachable completes, the stackOfBackedgedNodes
    ; will retain 'Node' iff there is at least one path to another node with an index at most 'nodeIndex(Node)'.

    ; This function computes the strongly connected components of a directed adjacency graph (DAG).
    ; This is done using a modified version of Tarjan's algorithm.  For more on this algorithm, see 
    ;      http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarjan%27s_strongly_connected_components_algorithm
    ; The 5-cent version of the algorithm is this:
    ;     A.  Every time you visit a new node, give it a number, called "index".  
    ;         This is a unique label for each node and the index for a new node is always higher than previous nodes' number.
    ;     B.  In addition, each node is assigned a second number, called "LowInd".
    ;         This will be the smallest "index" of any node that can be reached by following arrows forward from the current node.
    ;     C.  Finally, use a stack to keep track of all of the nodes that have a 'back edge' that allows a path to an earlier node.
    ; Assigning "LowInd" is a bit tricky, and is typically done recursively.
    ; The main idea of the algorithm is that after every call to the recursive function 'lowestNodeReachable' the stack of
    ; back edges should contain only nodes that have a path back to other nodes that are also on the stack.
    ; This stack is what allows the algorithm to keep track of backwards paths to the current component.  Forward paths are
    ; handled by following the directed edges forward using recursion.
    ; 
    ; The specific modification we'll use here is is that the "LowInd" value in the algorithm need *not* be initialized to the same value as "index".
    ; Instead, depending on a function parameter, it can be set to a blank value, which is treated as positive infinity.
    ; The effect of this is that any node without an out-arrow will have a LowInd of infinity when the algorithm completes.
    ; In particular, isolated nodes with no edges will be distinguished from isolated nodes with a reflexive edge.
    ; The parameters of the function are:
    ;     outArray - A mumps array (pass in by referency) that contains a numeric indicator of which strongly connected component of the
    ;                graph that the node is contained in.  The numeric index is obtained by Tarjans algorithm, and the upshot is that
    ;        any 2 nodes with the same numeric index are in the same component.
    ;        Depending on the setting of assumeSelfAdjacent, it's possible to get a node index of null.  These nodes are not in any
    ;        strongly-connected componenet of the graph.
    ;        An example of outArray might be:
    ;             outArray("node1")=""
    ;             outArray("node2")=2
    ;             outArray("node3")=3
    ;             outArray("node4")=2
    ;        This example has a strongly-connected component containing just node3, which means it must have a reflexive edge;
    ;        it also has a strongly connected component containing node2 and node4.
    ;        Finally, note that node1 in this example doesn't belong to any strongly connected component.  Thus, node1 is not
    ;        part of any cycle.
    ;     adjacencyMapPointer - This parameter is a pointer to a datastructure representing the edges in a graph.
    ;                   An example element would be
    ;                     @adjacencyMapPointer@(nodeName,otherNodeName) = truthy value
    ;     assumeSelfAdjacent - The truthiness of this parameter determines how Tarjan's algorithm treats isolated nodes.
    ;                          If this parameter evaluates to TRUE, then each node is considered to be adjacent to itself.
    ;              In other words, if this parameter is TRUE, an implicit arrow will be assumed to point from each node to itself.
    ;              Note that the standard version of Tarjan's algorithm assumes these implicit arrows.
    ; This function returns the size of the largest strongly-connected component of the graph.

    ; In most cases, the problem won't be this clear-cut.  The difficulty is references to external tokens.
    ; We don't necessarily know whether an external token always returns non-null or not.
    ; For example, consider this token definition:
    ;      @map@("token3")="options"
    ;      @map@("token3",1)="literal"
    ;      @map@("token3",1,"value")="BAR"
    ;      @map@("token3",2)="token"
    ;      @map@("token3",2,"value")="token4"
    ;      @map@("token3",3)="token"
    ;      @map@("token3",3,"value")="token5"
    ; Unless we can say whether or not token4 and token5 can be proven to always return non-null, we have no idea if token3 is provably non-null.
    ; To work around this difficulty, we pass in a list of tokenAssumptions.  This is just an array whose subscripts are token names and whose
    ; values have a truthiness indicating whether or not that token is assumed to always be non-null.
    ; We can hopefully draw a useful conclusion about a token under these assumptions about the other tokens.
    ; Additionally, this function returns a reduced map that contains the definition of the specified token up to the first known provably non-null.
    ;
    ; The algorithm is a tree walk of the grammer in @mapPointer@(token) using the machinery from ^PARSER2.
    ; The following logic is used:
    ;        subtree type     Rule for $$provablyNonNull return
    ;        ------------     ---------------------------------
    ;    ""       Return 0
    ;    literal      Return 0 iff the literal value is "", else return 1
    ;    token        Return the tokenAssumption for the specific token
    ;    delimList    Check listObject recursively, returning 1 iff listObject is provably non-null
    ;    subtreechain     Check each subtree recursively, returning 1 iff *any* subtree is provably non-null
    ;    options      Check each subtree recursively, returning 1 iff *all* subtrees are provably non-null
    ;
    ; The parameters of this function are as follows:
    ;       token - The name of the token we're interested in.  This must appear as a first subscript in @mapPointer
    ;   mapPointer - A string pointer to the array defining the grammer
    ;   tokenAssumptions - An array (pass by reference) of this form:
    ;                  tokenAssumptions( <otherToken> ) = truthy or falsey
    ;              Here the truthiness of the value indicates whether the otherToken is provably non-null.
    ;              An otherToken which has no subscript in tokenAssumptions is assumed to possibly allow null values.
    ;              (In other words, when a token doesn't appear in the tokenAssumptions array, we assume it might be null.)
    ;   reducedMapPointer - A string pointer to an array where the reduced definition of token will be placed.
    ;               This reduced grammar will only include the definition of the token up to the first provably non-null portion.
    ;               The grammer returned here will be at most as large as the grammer definition in @mapPointer@(token).

    ; This tag creates a subtree of the map such that the subtree contains only the portion of the
    ; token definitions that will contain the first character.
    ; In other words, this subtree will be the possible ways to start the token.
    ; Suppose that we have this grammer for a token:
    ;     @map@("token1")="subtreeChain"
    ;     @map@("token1",1)="options"
    ;     @map@("token1",1,1)="" ; null is an option
    ;     @map@("token1",1,2)="token"
    ;     @map@("token1",1,2,"value")="token2"
    ;     @map@("token1",2)="literal"
    ;     @map@("token1",2,"value")="foo"
    ;     @map@("token1",3)="token"
    ;     @map@("token1",3,"value")="token3"
    ; Possible strings in this grammer for token1 are:
    ;       token3 token4
    ;       token2 token3 token4
    ; The tree that contains only the possible first portions of this grammer is
    ;     @map@("token1")="subtreeChain"
    ;     @map@("token1",1)="options"
    ;     @map@("token1",1,1)="" ; empty option
    ;     @map@("token1",1,2)="token"
    ;     @map@("token1",1,2,"value")="token2"
    ;     @map@("token1",2)="literal"
    ;     @map@("token1",2,"value")="foo"
    ; Notice that this is *not* a grammer that exactly describes the possible first tokens.
    ; Instead, it's the minimal part of the tree necessary to include every possible first character of the tokens.
    ; In fact, the subtree above allows these strings
    ;           foo
    ;       token2 foo
    ; Also notice that every token occuring in the subtree could be the leading token in a represention of the
    ; token being defined (token1, in the example above).
    ; 
    ; The algorithm to create this reduced tree is easy in principle and tricky in practice.
    ; The entire reason for the complication is that we don't know if a token can return NULL or not.
    ; For instance, say we have a grammer that allows a string of this form:
    ;            token1""token2
    ; If token1 is always non-null, then the reduced tree returned should only allow strings of this form:
    ;                token1
    ; On the other hand, token1 might be null under certain circumstances, in which case strings of this form should also be allowed:
    ;                token1""token2
    ; To work around this difficulty, we need to apply the provablyNonNull function itteratively, allowing it to prove that more and more
    ; tokens are provably non-null.
    ; Once provablyNonNull has stabilized the collection of provably non-null tokens, it's easy to pick out the set of possible leading elements
    ; of each token.
    ; Note that provablyNonNull *must* eventually stabilize for either of the following 2 reasons:
    ;       1) A token shown to be provably non-null cannot later be shown to have null as a possible return possibility.
    ;      This is a monotonicity condition, and there are finitely many tokens that can eventually be shown to be provably non-null.
    ;   2) Every pass of provablyNonNull will make the reduced map no larger than it was before.
    ;      This is a monotonicity condition, and the starting map is of finite size.
    ; Of course, we haven't placed a bound on how long it can take the provablyNonNull helper function to stabilize...

    ; This tag analyzes the 'map' looking for instances of left-recursion in the grammer.
    ; This is a good sanity check on the 'map' because left-recursion will trap our recursive parser in an infinite loop.
    ; Algorithm:
    ;   1) Use leadingReference to produce a subtree of only possible leading characters
    ;   2) Use buildReferenceTree to reduce this new grammer to just a tree of token references.
    ;   3) Use dagStrongComponents to determine if any cycles could exist in the reduced grammar.
    ; Because leadingReferenceForToken returns a tree whose tokens are all of the possible ways a given token could
    ; begin, this algorithm will produce all possible ways that an infinite loop could occur in the parsers.
    ; The parameters of this function are
    ;       mapPointer - a string pointer to the array holding the map for parsing the tokens.
    ;   outList - an array (pass by reference) that holds the strong components of the directed adjacency graph
    ;         formed by the leading tokens of the grammer.
    ;         If this is non-empty, then there is an instance of left-recursion in the grammar.
    ; The function itself returns 1 or more when at least one instance of left-recursion is detected
