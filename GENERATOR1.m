    ; =====  OVERVIEW  ====
    ; This is a statement generator for any language that  can be expressed using a syntax diagram consisting only of:
    ;   1) string literals
    ;   2) options
    ;   3) delimited lists
    ;   4) named tokens.
    ; Note that it's possible to draw a syntax diagram that isn't of this form, but that's actually pretty tricky.
    ;
    ; This function returns a parse tree.
    ;
    ; ====  TECHNICAL TERMINOLOGY  ====
    ; The statement generate uses a sytax map, which is of the following form:
    ;       @map@(token1Name) = subtree1
    ;       @map@(token2Name) = subtree2
    ;                        ...
    ;       @map@(tokenName)  = subtree
    ; where each subtree is a MUMPS array describing the structure of each corresponding token. 
    ; The subtrees are described in greater detail in the in-routine documentation comments of PARSER1.
    ;
    ; As a brief overview, the structure of the subtrees, is of the generic form:
    ;               @subtree = subtree type
    ;               @subtree@("force") = the behavior of the generator to force when generating subtrees (or deeper subtrees).
    ;               @subtree@(subnodes) = additional data.
    ; The additional data can be quite extensive, and include references to other tokens, lists of options, string literal, etc.
    ;
    ; We allow these 6 types of subtrees:
    ;       1) "" to denote an empty subtree.  This is typically used with "options" and sometimes with "delimList".
    ;       2) "literal" for string literals,
    ;       3) "subtreeChain" to allow us to easily concatenate multiple subtrees together.
    ;       4) "options" to denote a list of options,
    ;       5) "delimList" to denote a delimited list,
    ;       6) "token" to reference another token.  Effectively, this is just a named subtree.
    ;
    ; For examples of these token types and the structures of the tokens, see the comments in the ^PARSER1 routine.
    ;
    ;
    ; *******************************
    ; 
    ; This is the core statement generator function that handles generic subtrees.
    ; The parameters are as follows:
    ;   subTreePointer - a string pointer to the fragment of map describing the subtree we're using to generate a statment
    ;   generatedResultPointer - a string pointer to the scalar in which the generated syntax will be held.
    ;   mapPointer - a string pointer to the root of the array holding the grammer map for generating the tokens.
    ;       (The map defined by @mapPointer must not have any instances of left-recursion!)
    ;   depthSeed - A positive integer that is used to limit how long our generated string will be.
    ;               When generating a delimList or a list of options that includes a null token, the depthSeed is
    ;               used to influence probability that the delimList will be halted or the null option will be picked.
    ;               This provides a probabalistic halting condition for the code generator.
    ;               (Without this, the statements that we generate would be infinitely long.)
    ; Returns the number of characters built.  Returns negative numbers in case of error.

    ;   2) "literal" for string literals, 
    ;   3) "subtreeChain" to act as a string of subtrees when creating a new token is too much of a pain.
    ;   4) "options" to denote a list of options,
    ;   5) "delimList" to denote a delimited list, 
    ;   6) "token" to reference another token

    ; As a reminder, the structure of a subTreeChain is:
    ;       @subtree = "subtreeChain"
    ;       @subtree@("force") = the behavior of the parser to force when parsing any literals defined in the deeper subtrees.
    ;               (An example value is "forceToLowerCase" to force input to be automatically changed to lowercase)
    ;               The forced behavior affects the parsing of this subtree and all sub-subtrees.
    ;       @subtree(1) = the 1st subtree.  Any valid @map@ root is valid here (without the human-readable description).
    ;       @subtree(2) = the 2nd subtree.  Any valid @map@ root is valid here (without the human-readable description).
    ;       ...

    ;   mapPointer - a string pointer to the array holding the map for parsing the tokens.
    ;       (The map defined by @mapPointer must not have any instances of left-recursion!)

    ;
    ;
    ; This generated data by choosing randomly between multiple options.
    ; Recall that the "options" type of subtree looks like this:
    ;       @subtree = "options"
    ;       @subtree@(1) = 1st option.  Any valid subtree is valid here
    ;       @subtree@(2) = 2nd option.  Any valid subtree is valid here
    ;       ...
    ;       @subtree@(n) = nth option.  Any valid subtree is valid here.
    ; This function works by randomly choosing among all of the options presented.
    ; If one of the options is blank, and if the value of $STACK is greater than the depthSeed parameter, 
    ; then the blank null option will be preferentially selected.  This probabalistically limits the length of the generated data.
    ; 
    ; The parameters are as follows:
    ;   subTreePointer - a string pointer to the fragment of map describing the subtree we're building with
    ;   generatedResultPointer - a string pointer to the scalar in which the generated syntax will be held.
    ;   mapPointer - a string pointer to the array holding the map that defines the grammar.
    ;       (The map defined by @mapPointer must not have any instances of left-recursion!)
    ;   depthSeed - A positive integer that is used to limit how long our generated string will be.
    ;               When generating a delimList or a list of options that includes a null token, the depthSeed is
    ;               used to influence probability that the delimList will be halted or the null option will be picked.

    ;
    ;
    ; This generates a delimited list.
    ; Note that in general, a delimited list is composed of a content subtree and a delimiter subtree, either of which could be empty.
    ; Here are the rules for delimited lists:
    ;   a) At least one instance of the list content needs to be present; 
    ;   b) an instance of the list content needs to be the first thing in a delimited list; 
    ;   c) an instance of the list content needs to be the last thing in a delimited list;
    ;   d) any 2 instances of list content need to be separated by exactly one delimiter.
    ; These rules are based on the representation of delimited lists as loops in syntax diagrams.
    ; Note that allowing the empty subtree as a delimiter or a content makes delimited lists more broadly useful:
    ;   - If the delimiter is the empty subtree, then the delimited list represents concatenation of *one* or more instances of the content.
    ;   - If the content subtree is the empty subtree, then the delimited list represents concatenation of *zero* or more delimiters.
    ; If the $STACK variable plus the position in the delimited list we're building exceeds depthSeed, the list building will be shortened.
    ; This shortening is done probabalistically.
    ;
    ; The parameters are as follows:
    ;   contentSubTreePointer - a string pointer to the fragment of map describing the content subtree of the grammar.
    ;   delimiterSubtreePointer - a string pointer to the fragment of map describing the delimiter subtree of the grammar.
    ;   generatedResultPointer - a string pointer to the scalar in which the generated syntax will be held.
    ;   mapPointer - a string pointer to the array holding the map for generating the tokens.
    ;   depthSeed - A positive integer that is used to limit how long our generated string will be.
