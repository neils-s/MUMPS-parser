    ; ====  OVERVIEW  ====
    ; This contains generic tree manipulation tools.  These tools use a MUMPS array representing a tree to derive a new tree. 
    ; The intent is to apply these tree tools to the parse tree returned by the code in ^PARSER1, producing an abstract syntax tree.
    ; More generally, the tools can be applied to a dataflow tree to prune it to a more human-readable form, or they can even be applied
    ; to an abstract syntax tree to produce an optimized (or at least 'improved') version of the tree that embodies the same functionality
    ; but functions more effeciently.
    ;
    ; This routine contains a small collection of helper-functions that make it easier to use one tree as a 'template' to build another.
    ; These functions are applied recursively to the source tree, and will be used to build the destination tree.
    ; There is also a general 'evaluate' function that can evaluate a 'tree-building rule' expressed as MUMPS code.
    ;
    ; Note that these functions don't purport to represent an effecient tree transversal algorithm.
    ; Also, there's no guarantee that it's possible to use these functions to transform a source tree to a destination tree in a single pass;
    ; it may be necessary to transform a source tree to an intermediate tree before creating a destination tree.
    ; In other words, your tree may need to factor through several intermediate trees before reaching it's final form.
    ;
    ;
    ; ====  EXAMPLE GOALS  ====
    ; As an example of the kinds of tree-building actions we'd like to use these tools for, we present some common actions taken
    ; in transforming a parse tree to an abstract syntax tree (AST), and even creating an 'optimized' the abstract syntax tree.
    ;
    ; 1) Skipping extraneous terminal nodes
    ; The most basic operation in creating an AST from a parse tree is the removal of nodes representing things like parenthesis,
    ; since operational precendence is already encapsulated in the structure of the abstract syntax tree itself.
    ; In pictures, we'd like to be able to use a tree like this:
    ;           sum
    ;          / | \
    ;         1  -  expr
    ;              /  |  \
    ;             (  sum  )
    ;               / | \
    ;              2  +  3
    ;
    ; to build a tree like this:
    ;           sum
    ;          / | \
    ;         1  -  expr
    ;                 |   
    ;                sum  
    ;               / | \
    ;              2  +  3
    ; 
    ; 2) Skipping extraneous intervening nodes
    ; Another common step in creating an AST from a parse tree is excising nodes that contain only one child.
    ; These intervening nodes don't typically carry any useful information, so they can often just go without any loss.
    ; This is especially useful in LL(1) parsers, which tend to create parse trees with *lots* of extraneous intervening nodes.
    ; In pictures, we want to use a tree like this:
    ;           sum
    ;          / | \
    ;         1  -  expr
    ;                 |   
    ;                sum  
    ;               / | \
    ;              2  +  3
    ; as a template to build a tree like this:
    ;               sum
    ;              / | \
    ;             1  -  sum
    ;                  / | \
    ;                 2  +  3
    ;
    ; 3) Assigning different names to nodes in destination tree
    ; Using the contents of the child (or grand-child, or great grand-child, etc.) nodes to rename a node is a common
    ; step to take when creating an AST from a parse tree.
    ; In pictures, we want to use a tree like this:
    ;           sum
    ;          / | \
    ;         1  -  sum
    ;              / | \
    ;             2  +  3
    ;
    ; as a template to build a tree like this:
    ;           -
    ;          /|\
    ;         1 - +
    ;            /|\
    ;           2 + 3
    ;
    ; 4) Conditionally skipping nodes or a certain type
    ; Sometimes, in transforming a tree, we'll want to evaluate logic to determine if a node should be copied from the source tree to the
    ; destination tree.  For instance, we might not want to copy nodes that have a name of '+' or '-' if those nodes have no children.
    ; In pictures, we want a tree like this:
    ;           -
    ;          /|\
    ;         1 - +
    ;            /|\
    ;           2 + 3
    ;
    ; To act as a template to build a tree like this:
    ;           -
    ;          / \
    ;         1   +
    ;            / \
    ;           2   3
    ;
    ; 5) Skipping an entire subtree (a node and all it's subnodes)
    ; When a grammer is over-specified, or when lexing is done badly, it's possible to end up with lots of tokens in the parse tree
    ; that are below the level of the lexemes.  For example, it's possible to imagine a grammer that specifies an 'integer' as a 
    ; 'nonzero-digit' followed by a finite string of 'digits'.  In this case, the individual digits that make up the 'integer' have
    ; no semantic meaning, and all of that granular sub-structure can be removed.
    ; In pictures, we want a tree like this:
    ;               integer(103)
    ;                   /   \
    ;             non-zero   integer_piece
    ;                |         /      \
    ;                1      digit    integer_piece
    ;                         |        /      \
    ;                         0     digit    integer_piece
    ;                                  |       |
    ;                                 3         null
    ;
    ; to act as a template to build a tree like this: 
    ;                  integer(103)
    ;
    ; 6) Moving a subtree (a node and all it's subnodes) when building the destination tree
    ; Depending on the way the grammer is written, it's possible (likely) that nodes will end up in different parts of the tree when
    ; you'd prefer to have them nearby.
    ; As an example (stolen from http://eli.thegreenplace.net/2009/02/16/abstract-vs-concrete-syntax-trees/) consider the way the C
    ; parser handles pointer declarations.
    ; When the C parser is given a statement like "int * foo;", it returns a tree that is similar to
    ;                    declaration
    ;                    /    |     \
    ;           specifiers    |      ;
    ;            /        declarators
    ;   type_spec         |
    ;     /          declarator
    ;   INT           /      \
    ;              pointer   direct_declarator
    ;               /           \
    ;              *           identifier
    ;                                \
    ;                               foo
    ; OUCH!
    ; With the strategies we've outlined above, we can simplify to a tree like this:
    ;                    declaration
    ;                    /         \
    ;           type_spec           \
    ;                 /             declarator
    ;                INT              /      \
    ;                           pointer    identifier
    ;                                         \
    ;                                         foo
    ; Still ouch!
    ; By moving the 'pointer' subtree to lie under the 'INT' subnode, and re-applying the earlier strategies,
    ; we achieve this tree:
    ;                   declaration
    ;                    /        \   
    ;           type_spec  identifier
    ;                   |          |
    ;                  INT        foo
    ;                   |
    ;                pointer
    ; Nicer.
    ; The type information needed to type-check 'foo' is now stacked nicely.  Under this scheme, the dereference operator could be seen as popping off the
    ; 'pointer' off of the bottom of the 'type_spec' tree
    ;
    ;
    ; ====  DECISION MAKING ====
    ; The question remains:  How do we decide which nodes of the source get copied to the target, and how do we decide where on the target to copy them?
    ; To answer this question, a rule framework is applied.  This framework is designed around a few philosophical guidelines:
    ; A) All code needed for decision-making should be contained in this routine.
    ;    It's likely that external code will call into this routine, and it should be agnostic to the structure of this routine.
    ; B) Little or no raw MUMPS code should be needed for the decision making.
    ;    If we run raw code in this routine (even well-intentioned code), we're likely step on local variables and break something.
    ; C) The actions are distinctly separate from the decision-making.
    ;    Encouraging a strict wall between decision and action makes the code look much nicer.
    ; D) The rules and actions to apply should be structured as a tree.
    ;    A dichotomous tree is a very well known general structure for decision-making.
    ; E) The decision-making code should be designed to act via recursion.
    ;    The source tree, target tree, and even the rule tree all lend themselves to recursive traversal.
    ; F) At each stage of the recursion, the results of the tree-crawling on the current node should be available to the child nodes.
    ;    This will actually cause the tree-crawler to operate in a root-to-leaves direction.
    ;    This also means that some 'caching' mechanism can be used to pass information from the current node to the child nodes.
    ; G) On each node, the entire rule tree should be evaluated.
    ;    This *massively* simplifies the code.
    ; H) It shouldn't be necessary to capture all logic in a single rule-tree.
    ;    We can apply many rule trees, modifying the original source tree itteratively through a series of intermediate trees to a final target.
    ;    As an added bonus, this means we shouldn't need to run custom setup code in an 'initialization' phase.  Instead, we can create an
    ;    intermediate tree with the same structure as the source tree, but where the nodes have additional 'initialization data'.
    ;    The down-side of this guideline is that the transformation from source tree to final target tree could take *lots* of steps, and
    ;    therefore take lots of time.
    ;
    ; Here's a rough schematic of the algorithm for the tree crawler:
    ; a) Initialization phase
    ;   1) increment a %treeDepth counter up by 1.  The way to accomplish this without having to decrement later is to reNEW the %treeDepth variable
    ;   2) NEW a local variable at this %treeDepth level to serve as a cache for information. This cache will be accessible down the recursion stack.
    ;   3) NEW an array to hold the returns of the child nodes
    ; b) Evaluate the entire rule tree on this node.  The rule tree is structured like this
    ;              (parent)
    ;                  |
    ;               ACTION
    ;                  |
    ;                RULE
    ;               /    \
    ;           true?    false?
    ;            |          |
    ;        (child)      (child)
    ;   1) At each stage in the rule tree, we evaluate the ACTION first.  Here are some allowed actions
    ;         - Set the returnVal that will be passed up the tree
    ;         - Add a key/value pair to the cache at the current %treeDepth level
    ;         - Add a key/value pair to the cache at %treeDepth level 0
    ;         - Update the pointer to the target tree
    ;         - Set/build/destroy a node in the target tree
    ;         - Do nothing
    ;   2) After the action, evaluate the rule.  The rule will have access to this information
    ;         - Cached values.  The retrieval of a cached key/value pair will cascade down the stack to %treeDepth level 0 to try to retrieve data.
    ;         - Current returnVal.
    ;         - Array of data returned from the tree-crawler's action on the children of the current source node.
    ;         - The value at the current source node
    ;         - the value of the current target node
    ;         - Boolean logic
    ;   3) If the RULE is blank, we've reached a stopping point in the rule tree
    ;   4) If the RULE returns true, then the rule tree is followed down the 'true' branch to more ACTIONs and RULEs.
    ;   5) If the RULE returns false, then the rule tree is followed down the 'false' branch to more ACTIONs and RULEs.
    ;    By evaluating the rule tree before passing to the child nodes, we can take actions like building an analogue to the current node,
    ;    or cache information to pass to the child nodes when they're evaluated in the recursion step.
    ; c) Recursion step
    ;   1) Get a pointer to the first child node.
    ;   2) Starting at the first child, use an itterator to move over all of the child nodes, recursively call the tree-crawler for each one.
    ;   3) Collect the result of the tree-crawler on each child node in a local array.
    ; d) Create a local variable, returnVal, that will be returned up the chain to the calling instance of the tree-crawler.
    ; e) Set a local flag that signals that we've processed all child nodes
    ; f) Evaluate the entire rule tree on the node again.
    ;    This will allow the rule tree to act on data returned by the child nodes.
    ; g) Return the current returnVal to the calling instance of the tree-crawler.
    ;
    ;
    ; ====  TECHNICAL NEEDS  ====
    ; Motivated by the examples above, functions will be created to navigate the source and destination
    ; trees, to make decisions based on the contents of the source tree, and to build the destination
    ; tree.

    ;   cacheKeyValue(key,value,toGlobalLevel)
    ;   getCachedValue(key)
    ;   getReturnVal()
    ;   setReturnVal(value)
    ;   evalRule(aNode,rule)
    ;   applyAction(sourceNode,targetNode,actionCode)
    ;   evalDecisionTree(sourceNode,targetNode,decisionTree)
